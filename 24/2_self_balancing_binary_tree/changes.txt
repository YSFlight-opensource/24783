1. Keep track of the node count.
      int nNode;

   nNode=0 in Constructor
   nNode=0 in CleanUp

   ++nNode in Add
   --nNode in Delete


2. In Add, count the depth.

3. In Add, if depth exceeds the minimum depth*2, rebalance.

4. In main, add a number in a sequence instead of random, and check the tree is re-balanced.
