from point_sprite_with_texture

1. Add particle.cpp , particle.h

2. Delete vertex buffers for billboard and point-sprites

3. Add member variable
	int nParticle;
    ParticleGroup particleGroup;

4. In Initialize
	nParticle=1000;
	particleGroup.MakeCloud(nParticle,YsVec3(-8,-4,-8),YsVec3(8,4,8));
	particleGroup.MakeVertexBuffer();

5. Delete drawing of wireframe cube

   glClearColor(0.2,0.2,0.7,0.0);

6. Modify particle drawing so that it uses the vertex attribute buffers in the particle data structure.

But, something is strange.
